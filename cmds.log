QUESTION:
Repeat worksheet #2 using awk to get the entire reviews that are verified or not. 

Use awk to get the entire text of the verified and unverified reviews

Redirect the "verified" true reviews to a file "verified.txt".

Then put the unverified reviews in another file "unverified.txt" using redirection.

Find the 10 most frequent words in the review_body of the verified reviews, 
then find the 10 most frequent words in the review_body of the unverified reviews. 
Note: If this is taking too long for the entire dataset, 
it is sufficient to do it just for 100 reviews so you get an idea.

ANSWER:
To answer the question, I created two files, "verified.txt" and "unverified.txt"
I used 2 commands to filter verified and unverified reviews into those files
Then, using a command similar to one from Assignment 3,
I filtered out commas, dots, semicolons, and keywords "and" "or" "if" "in" it"
and all other one or two letter words from the reviews.
Then all blanks were turned into new line starts, and the words were sorted and counted
to get top 10 a simple head command is at the end of the pipe
